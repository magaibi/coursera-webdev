# Module 4 Coding Assignment (Extract from Lecturer notes)

Coursera course: [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers]
(https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers)

**Summary:** In this assignment:
1. Loop over an array of names and print out either a `hello` or `goodbye` to that name
   to the browser console.
	 - If the name starts with a letter `j` or `J`, you are to print out `Goodbye JSomeName`.
	 - If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out `Hello SomeName`.
2. In order to do that printing you will have to use 2 externally provided libraries whose
   code is not 100% ready to be used. Using the things we've learned in this module, your
	 job will be to fix the code in those libraries.
	 You will get some starter code to work with where all the steps of what you need to do
	 are clearly spelled out for you.

Here is what you will need to do in order to complete the assignment:
1. Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your
   solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example,
	 `module4-solution` or `mod4_solution`, etc.
2. Download the starter files for this project and copy them into your solution container
   folder (e.g., into `module4-solution`). Since assignments and starter code get updated
	 from time to time, don't assume that you have the latest version already on your system.
	 The best way to ensure that you are working with the very latest starter code is either:
	 - `git clone` the `fullstack-course4` repository into a new directory OR,
	 - if you've already done 'git clone' previously, you can simply open up your command
	   prompt (cmd on Windows or Terminal on Mac), navigate to the folder where the
		 `fullstack-course4` repository was previously cloned into and do: `git pull`.
		 The full repository URL can be found at:
     https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course4**
3. Once the local repository on your system is up to date, choose between:
   (a) **Harder**:
	     If you want a _slightly_ more challenging assignment, copy all the contents of the
	`fullstack-course4/assignments/assignment4/assignment4-solution-starter/harder`
	     folder into your newly created solutions container folder for this assignment, e.g., 'module4-solution'.
	 (b) **Easier**:
	     If you want a _slightly_ less challenging assignment, copy all the contents of the
	`fullstack-course4/assignments/assignment4/assignment4-solution-starter/easier` folder
	     into your newly created solutions container folder for this assignment, e.g.,
			 'module4-solution'.
4. Once you've copied the starter code of your choice into your solution folder,
   - open up your solution folder in the code editor.
	 - open up `script.js` file and follow the steps.
	 NOTE: the provided starter code will not run. It is up to you to follow the instructions
	       to get it to run.
5. When you are continuously working on the assignment:
   - use Browser Sync and keep Chrome open to the Console tab of the Chrome Developer Tools.
	   The browser-sync can be run in the background (&) as below:
		    browser-sync start --server --directory --files "**/*" &
	 - You will likely see errors there to start with. Follow the steps outlined in the starter
	   code and those errors should go away by the time you finish the last step.
	 - If you still see errors at that point or you are not seeing the output you're supposed
	   to see, you probably made a mistake somewhere, so look into that and investigate.

   Remember, if you are stuck, ask questions on the course Discussion forum.

6. That's it!
